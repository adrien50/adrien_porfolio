# [Employee Performance Analysis project](https://github.com/adrien50/Employees-performance-analysis)

INX Future Inc, is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. In recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this has become a growing concern among the top management. The CEO Mr. Brain, decided to initiate a data science project, which analyzes the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of the performance issues. He also expects a clear indicators of non-performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals. The Goal and Insights of the project are defined as follows :

- Departements wise performances.
- Top 3 Important factors affecting employee performance.
- A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.


# [FORECASTING of WALMART SALES using MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/adrien50/walmartproject)

Every Departmental store chain like Walmart wants to predict the store sales in the nearby future so that inventory planning can be done. Along with that, sales prediction helps to increase/decrease store staff based on the rush (More sales can mean more customers are coming to the stores). Also, it is always a good idea to do sales and revenue forecasting to better understand the company's cash-flows and overall growth. For inventory planning, you also need to know what products (or category of products aka department) will be utilised more. Under-stock some products and your sales are hit. Over-stock items like perishables and you run into losses if the product expires. That's why the sales prediction is done at a combination of store and department level (and sometimes even at product level for high-selling products).

In this problem, we have been given the sales data of 45 stores based on store, department and week. The size and type of each store has been provided. Holiday weeks have been marked. Along with these, price markdown data (almost like discount data) has been given. A few macro-indicators like CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc. are also provided.


# [Bigmart sales predictions](https://github.com/adrien50/Bigmartsales)

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales. The data has missing values as some stores do not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.


# [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/adrien50/creditcarddetection)

Fraud detection, one of the many cases of anomaly detection is an important aspect of financial markets. Is there any way to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on the history of transactions? It is often that the data we retrieve have imbalanced label and we are asked to make classification. These scenarios are troublesome since not only the models we usally use bring poor result, but also the evaluation metric we often used, accuracy, is not adequate for imbalanced data sets due to the impact of the minority class. This project aims to demonstrate some techniques used to combat these situations, such as resampling or cluster before predicting, as well as using PR (Precision-Recall) curve to evaluate model.

# [Loan Eligibility Prediction using Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://github.com/adrien50/loanprediction)

SYL bank is one of Australia's largest banks. Currently, the loan applications which come in to their various branches are processed manually. The decision whether to grant a loan or not is subjective and due to a lot of applications coming in, it is getting harder for them to decide the loan grant status. Thus, they want to build an automated machine learning solution which will look at different factors and decide whether to grant loan or not to the respective individual.

In this ML problem, we will building a classification model as we have to predict if an applicant should get a loan or not. We will look at various factors of the applicant like credit score, past history and from those we will try to predict the loan granting status. We will also cleanse the data and fill in the missing values so that our ML model performs as expected. Thus we will be giving out a probability score along with Loan Granted or Loan Refused output from the model.

# [Modeling Earthquake Damage](https://github.com/adrien50/earthquake-damage-pridiction)

Based on aspects of building location and construction, your goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, which works under the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal.
This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected, containing valuable information on earthquake impacts, household conditions, and socio-economic-demographic statistics.

# [Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction.](https://github.com/adrien50/Porto-Seguro-s-Safe-Driver-Prediction)

Nothing ruins the thrill of buying a brand new car more quickly than seeing your new insurance bill. The sting’s even more painful when you know you’re a good driver. It doesn’t seem fair that you have to pay so much if you’ve been cautious on the road for years.
Porto Seguro, one of Brazil’s largest auto and homeowner insurance companies, completely agrees. Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.
In this project, you’re challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.

# [NLP classification chatbot](https://github.com/adrien50/NLPclassification-chatbot)

Human language is astoundingly complex and diverse. When we write, we often misspell or abbreviate words, or omit punctuation. There is a lot of unstructured data around us. Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.

Understanding this will enable us to build the core component of any conversational chatbot. In this NLP application we will create the core engine of a chat bot. We will learn text classification using the techniques of natural language processing by using the nltk library.

# [Home Credit Default Risk project. Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan?](https://github.com/adrien50/home-loancredit-risk)

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

While Home Credit is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data. Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

# [Machine Learning project for Retail Price Optimization](https://github.com/adrien50/Retail-Price-Optimization)

Pricing a product is a crucial aspect in any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to price different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are quite sensitive to their prices and as such a small change in their price can lead to noticeable change in their sales. While there are products whose sales are not much affected by their price - these tend to be either luxury items or necessities (like certain medicines). This machine learning retail price optimization project will focus on the former type of products.
In this machine learning pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items. For each item, first the price elasticity will be calculated and then the optimal price will be figured. While this is taking a particular cafe data, this work can be extended to price any product.
