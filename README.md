# [Employee Performance Analysis project](https://github.com/adrien50/Employees-performance-analysis)

INX Future Inc, is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. In recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this has become a growing concern among the top management. The CEO Mr. Brain, decided to initiate a data science project, which analyzes the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of the performance issues. He also expects a clear indicators of non-performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals. The Goal and Insights of the project are defined as follows :

- Departements wise performances.
- Top 3 Important factors affecting employee performance.
- A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.


# [FORECASTING of WALMART SALES using MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS](https://github.com/adrien50/walmartproject)

Every Departmental store chain like Walmart wants to predict the store sales in the nearby future so that inventory planning can be done. Along with that, sales prediction helps to increase/decrease store staff based on the rush (More sales can mean more customers are coming to the stores). Also, it is always a good idea to do sales and revenue forecasting to better understand the company's cash-flows and overall growth. For inventory planning, you also need to know what products (or category of products aka department) will be utilised more. Under-stock some products and your sales are hit. Over-stock items like perishables and you run into losses if the product expires. That's why the sales prediction is done at a combination of store and department level (and sometimes even at product level for high-selling products).

In this problem, we have been given the sales data of 45 stores based on store, department and week. The size and type of each store has been provided. Holiday weeks have been marked. Along with these, price markdown data (almost like discount data) has been given. A few macro-indicators like CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc. are also provided.


# [Bigmart sales predictions](https://github.com/adrien50/Bigmartsales)

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales. The data has missing values as some stores do not report all the data due to technical glitches. Hence, it will be required to treat them accordingly.


# [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/adrien50/creditcarddetection)

Fraud detection, one of the many cases of anomaly detection is an important aspect of financial markets. Is there any way to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on the history of transactions? It is often that the data we retrieve have imbalanced label and we are asked to make classification. These scenarios are troublesome since not only the models we usally use bring poor result, but also the evaluation metric we often used, accuracy, is not adequate for imbalanced data sets due to the impact of the minority class. This project aims to demonstrate some techniques used to combat these situations, such as resampling or cluster before predicting, as well as using PR (Precision-Recall) curve to evaluate model.
